2005-09-05  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@vault.valis.nyu.edu>

	* defsystem.lisp:
	Made several changes to ensure that Sam Steingold modifications to
	control evaluation of definition slots do not interfere with
	subcomponents.

	Cleaned up the code in several places.

	Added RUN-SHELL-COMMAND (modified from UFFI and ASDF to make it
	more portable).
	The original versions were by Dan Barlow and Kevin Rosenberg.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

	* defsystem.lisp:
	After a suggestion by David Tolpin, the code is simplified even more,
	and the logic should be now more clear: use the user supplied pieces
	of the pathname if non NIL.

2005-03-09  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@vault.valis.nyu.edu>

	* defsystem.lisp:
	Change in COMPONENT-FULL-PATHNAME-I.  The treatment of PATHNAME-HOST
	and PATHNAME-DEVICE in the call to MAKE-PATHNAME in the T branch of
	the last COND is bogus.  COMPONENT-DEVICE and COMPONENT-HOST must
	respect the ANSI definition, hence, they cannot be PATHNAMEs.  The
	simplification of the code is useful and it should make MK:DEFSYSTEM
	work better with OpenMCL and other systems.  SCL compatibility may be
	broken, but I doubt it will.

2005-03-03  pvaneynd  <pvaneynd@vault>

	* debian/changelog, debian/control:
	debian release 3.4i+cvs.2005.03.03.1

2005-02-04  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@vault.valis.nyu.edu>

	* defsystem.lisp:

	Robert Goldman.)

2005-01-28  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@vault.valis.nyu.edu>

	* defsystem.lisp:
	Fixed loading of foreign libraries in Lispworks, which uses different
	functions on different platoforms.

2005-01-04  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@vault.valis.nyu.edu>

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

	* defsystem.lisp:
	Added small patch to the computation of COMPONENT-HOST to accommodate
	a recent change in CMUCL.  The patch ensures that eventually the
	default host is taken from *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*.
	Thanks to Raymond Toy for this patch.

2004-06-28 14:50  rtoy

	* defsystem.lisp: o Change default for *DONT-REDEFINE-REQUIRE* to T
	  for SBCL and for   CMUCL (when *module-provider-functions*
	  exists).  We don't want   defsystem redefining REQUIRE in this
	  case.  o Add module-provider support for CMUCL, if
	  *module-provider-functions* exists.

2004-06-17 16:38  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Added support for SBCL (and, in perspective
	  CMUCL) *module-provider-functions* to play nice with REQUIRE.

2004-06-15 17:26  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Two changes: 1 - Fixed a buglet introduced in the
	  previous set of changes while     adding support for "recursive
	  defsystems".	2 - Completed support for "recursive defsystems":
	    A DEFSYSTEM definition can not have components of the form

		  (:system "foo")

	      or

		  (:system "foo" :depends-on (...))

	      As long as the :system (or :subsystem) component spec does
	  not
	      contain any :components, then MK:DEFSYSTEM will take this to
	  be a
	      "recursive defsystem" definition and try to load a system
	  named
	      "foo.system" from the "foo" subdirectory.  It can be argued
	  that
	      this makes life more easier and more natural.

2004-04-27 09:56  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Fixed a problem with APPEND_LOGICAL_PNAMES that
	  caused Matlisp not to compile properly.  The problem stemmed from
	  the different settings of PATHNAME-HOST on CMUCL and LW.  The fix
	  should be transparent across implementations.

2004-03-10 10:43  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Made some changed to APPEND-DIRECTORIES,
	  APPEND-LOGICAL-PNAMES and TRANSLATE-VERSION to circumvent a bug
	  in Lispworks MERGE-PATHNAMES.  As a result the system is
	  altogether safer because now we operate on pathnames more
	  consistently.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated.

2004-01-24 12:48  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Added and exported some specialized contidions
	  for missing system components.  Added and exported
	  SYSTEM-DEFINITION-PATHNAME.  Changed slightly (in a backward
	  compatible way) the way a system is looked up in a directory
	  tree.  Now (MK:FIND-SYSTEM "foo") will also find 'foo/foo.system'
	  -- provided that the directory 'foo' is visible from the
	  registry.

2004-01-23 09:59  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Drop support for versions of CMUCL older than
	  cmu17.  Thus, assume the feature :cmu means cmu17 and later.
	  This will make defsystem a little more robust against changes in

	* defsystem.lisp: Remove the :new-compiler conditionalization for
	  CMUCL.  All CMUCL versions from 18a and later used the new
	  compiler, and versions after 18e will have the :new-compiler
	  feature removed.

2003-04-28 14:50  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Changed some of the condizionalizations to take
	  care of PROVIDE/REQUIRE hacking for various CL (especially
	  MCL/OpenMCL).  The new CMUCL version - 18e - may have some
	  glitches due to the unclear status of the :NEW-COMPILER feature.
	  Please be patient about it.

	  compliant.

	  Also added first cut code to achieve "pathname less" operation of
	  MK3, following the ideas in ASDF.  If the DEFSYSTEM form is
	  loaded from a file, then the location of the file (intended as a
	  directory) is computed from *LOAD-PATHNAME* and stored as the
	  :SOURCE-PATHNAME of the system.

	  still generates an error.

	* defsystem.lisp: LispWorks does not accept (inhibit-warnings 3).

2001-07-26 09:47  sds

	* ChangeLog, defsystem.lisp: (new-append-directories): removed
	  CLISP-specific type upcasing

	* defsystem.lisp: Manually sync'ed defsystem.lisp with updates done
	  in c-l-c's defsystem.lisp.  Apart from some whitespace and
	  version tags they should not differ much.  Have tested with clean
	  cmucl and clisp and it seems to work nicely but probably needs
	  more testing.  In case the common-lisp-controller conditionals
	  are too intrusive on verbosity-control, one might get the
	  previous version.  Good luck.

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog added.

2001-06-06 08:35  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Changed definition of 'compile-file-operation' to
	  meet requirements for COMMON-LISP-CONTROLLER.

	  Added a few fixes for LispWorks on PC/Windows.

	* defsystem.lisp: (component-full-pathname-i): init device from
	  `pathname'  when it is nil in the `component'

2001-02-06 13:04  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (run-compiler): `error-file' and
	  `error-file-stream'  should exist only under #+cmu

2001-01-09 07:56  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: updated for CMUCL 18c, where :cmu17 is not a
	  feature anymore (component): type defaults to `:file'

2000-07-26 10:11  rtoy

	* defsystem.lisp: Add COMPILER-OPTIONS to COMPONENT defstruct to
	  allow user to specify special compiler options for a particular
	  component.

2000-05-16 14:51  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (system-source-size): message tweak

2000-05-16 09:08  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (pathname-logical-p): fixed the CLISP version
	  (`logical-pathname-p' was called but not defined) and unified
	  both versions into one.

2000-05-15 08:17  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (c-compile-file): ignore `error-file' (kill a
	  warning)

2000-05-12 11:38  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (*central-registry*): fixed for lispworks4 (from
	  dey)

2000-05-11 09:09  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (system-source-size): new optional argument
	  `force'

2000-05-10 15:00  rtoy

	* defsystem.lisp: CMUCL and CLISP RUN-PROGRAM want the arguments as
	  a list of strings.  Change RUN-UNIX-PROGRAM so the arguments are
	  a list.  Convert the list to a string for the other platforms.
	  (Not tested.)

	  Modify C-COMPILE-FILE accordingly.

2000-05-10 14:26  rtoy

	* defsystem.lisp: Don't default binary-extension so we can inherit
	  this from the parent, just like source-extension.

2000-04-19 11:44  haible

	* defsystem.lisp: Add three #+clisp, to silence warnings.

2000-04-07 13:21  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (component source-extension): do not supply an
	  init form (stig's patch)

2000-03-29 15:07  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: (*filename-extensions*): use
	  `compile-file-pathname' to find the default binary extension.

2000-03-23 09:03  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Fixed problem with ACL and construction of system
	  filenames in COMPUTE-SYSTEM-PATH.

	  Also fixed problem with exports conflicting with native ACL and
	  LW defsystems.  No symbol is now imported in COMMON-LISP-USER.
	  You must always use the package qualifier "MK:" to access
	  LOAD-SYSTEM, COMPILE-SYSTEM and friends.

2000-03-22 14:03  haible

	* defsystem.lisp: *filename-extensions* needs only one entry for
	  CLISP, not two.

2000-03-15 09:10  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Fixed the '*defsystem-version* variable to
	  reflect the current version.

2000-03-03 15:15  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: do not redefine provide/require under clisp

2000-03-03 08:24  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: Added change suggested by Raymond Toy and
	  function PATHNAME-LOGICAL-P.	The beast has been tested lightly
	  with no problems encountered.

2000-02-28 01:19  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp: The symbols FIND-SYSTEM, LOAD-SYSTEM, DEFSYSTEM,
	  COMPILE-SYSTEM and HARDCOPY-SYSTEM are no longer imported in the
	  COMMON-LISP-USER package. Cfr. the definitions of *EXPORTS* and
	  *SPECIAL-EXPORTS*.

2000-02-18 14:28  sds

	* .cvsignore: ignore the compiled files

2000-02-16 11:47  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: finally, works with CLISP
	  (*filename-extensions*): clisp uses `lsp', not `lisp'
	  (*standard-source-file-types*, *standard-binary-file-types*):
	  removed (never used) (component): default `source-extension' and
	  `binary-extension' on `*filename-extensions*', not hardwired
	  `lisp/fasl' (default-source-extension, default-binary-extension):
	  default based on `*filename-extensions*', not not hardwired
	  `lisp/fasl'

2000-02-11 08:17  sds

	* defsystem.lisp: compile with clisp

2000-01-29 10:20  marcoxa

	* defsystem.lisp:
	  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
